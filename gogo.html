<h2>1.PRISONER OF AZKABAN DIRECTOR ALFONSO CUARON ASKED THE TRIO TO WRITE ESSAYS
  ABOUT THEIR CHARACTERS.</h2>

<p>Alfonso Cuaron wanted Watson,Radcliffe, and Grint to write essays about their
 characters from a first person point of view. According to Heyman,"they all
responded very much in character. Dan wrote a page, Emma wrote 10 and Rupert
didn't deliver anything." Grint told Entertainment Weekly, "I didn't do mine,
because I didn't think Ron would. Or that was my excuse. At the time, I was
actually quite busy with the real schoolwork involved with my exams, and I just
didn't do it. But in the end, it felt right because that's what Ron would have done."</p>

<h2>2.RUPERT GRINT'S AUDITION WAS UNUSUAL.</h2>

<p>Nine-year-old Emma Watson's first audition for the role of Hermione took place
in her school gym;she auditioned a total of eight times. Grint, then 10,sent in
a video audition, and went in a rather unusual direction: "I found out that you
could audition by sending a picture of yourself and some information to Newsround,
"he said in 2002. “I did my own video with me, first of all, pretending to be my
drama teacher who unfortunately was a girl and then I did a rap of how I wanted
to be Ron and then I made my own script thing up and sent it off."He had some
competition,though:Tom Felton auditioned for both Ron and Harry before ultimately
being cast as Draco Malfoy.</p>

<h2>3.SHE CREATED QUIDDITCH AFTER A FIGHT WITH HER BOYFRIEND.</h2>

<p>"If you want to create a game like Quidditch,what you have to do is have an
enormous argument with your then-boyfriend," Rowling said in 2003."You walk out
of the house, you sit down in a pub, and you invent Quidditch. And I don't really
know what the connection is between the row and Quidditch except that Quidditch
is quite a violent game and maybe in my deepest, darkest soul I would quite like
 to see him hit by a bludger."</p>

 <h2>4.DUMBLEDORE WAS GAY.</h2>

<p>In 2007, when asked by a fan whether or not Hogwarts's favorite headmaster had
ever been in love, Rowling responded, “I always thought of Dumbledore as gay."She
revealed that he had fallen in love with Grindelwald, "and that added to his horror
 when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.""

Rowling said she found the reaction to the news very interesting."To me it was not
a big deal," she told Radcliffe. “This is a very old man who has a very terrible
job to do. And his gayness is not really relevant. Very relevant to him as a
character, because I always saw him as a very lonely character. And I think that
 there is in fact a hint of it in [Deathly Hallows] because of the relationship
 he has with Grindelwald. He fell very hard for this boy .And don’t you think it
  was perfect that Dumbledore, who is always the great champion of love . his one
   great experience of love was utterly tragic."</p>
