<center><h2>1. ROWLING AND HARRY SHARE A BIRTHDAY.</h2></center>


<center><p>They both blow out candles on July 31(happy birthday, JKR!).And that's
not the only influence Rowling had on her characters:She's said that Hermione is
 a bit like her when she was younger, and her favorite animal is an otter-which
 is, of course,Hermione's patronus.Plus,both Dumbledore and Rowling like sherbet
lemons(Rowling said that the wizar's "got good taste").</p></center>

 <p>In 2000,Scholastic gave schoolchildren across the U.S.the opportunity to ask
Rowling questions about Harry Potter. When one student asked her, "What made you
think of the people's names and dormitories at Hogwarts?" Rowling responded, "I
invented the names of the Houses on the back of an airplane sick bag! This is
true. I love inventing names, but I also collect unusual names, so that I can
look through my notebook and choose one that suits a new character."</p>

<h3>3. EARLY ON, ROWLING WROTE A SKETCH OF THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE FINAL BOOK.</h3>

<p>Rowling calls the idea that she had the first chapter of Deathly Hallows writ
ten and locked away in the safe "rubbish."But there was a small element of truth
to it: "I had, very early on-but not the first day or anything, probably within
the first year of writing-I wrote a sketch for what I thought the final chapter
would be," she told Harry Potter's big screen portrayer, Daniel Radcliffe, in an
 interview for the Deathly Hallows Part 2 DVD extra features. "I always knew-and
 this was from really early on-that I was working toward the point where Hagrid
 carried Harry, alive but supposedly dead, out of the forest, always.</p>

 <h3>4. THE DEMENTORS ARE BASED ON ROWLING’S STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION AFTER HER

<p>Rowling's mother,who had multiple sclerosis,died in 1990, after which Rowling
suffered a period of depression.She would use the experience to characterize the
Harry Potter's dementors, creepy creatures that feed on human emotion. "It's so
difficult to describe [depression] to someone who's never been there, because
it's not sadness," Rowling told Oprah Winfrey. "I know sadness. Sadness is to
cry and to feel. But it's that cold absence of feeling—that really hollowed-out
feeling. That's what Dementors are."</p>
