1. ROWLING AND HARRY SHARE A BIRTHDAY.

<p>They both blow out candles on July 31(happy birthday, JKR!).And that's not the
only influence Rowling had on her characters: She's said that Hermione is a bit
like her when she was younger, and her favorite animal is an otter-which is, of
course,Hermione's patronus. Plus,both Dumbledore and Rowling like sherbet lemons
 (Rowling said that the wizar's "got good taste").</p>

<h3>2. SHE INVENTED THE NAMES OF THE HOGWARTS HOUSES ON THE BACK OF A BARF BAG.</h3>

 <p>In 2000,Scholastic gave schoolchildren across the U.S.the opportunity to ask
Rowling questions about Harry Potter. When one student asked her, “What made you
think of the people's names and dormitories at Hogwarts?” Rowling responded, “I
invented the names of the Houses on the back of an airplane sick bag! This is
true. I love inventing names, but I also collect unusual names, so that I can
look through my notebook and choose one that suits a new character.” </p>
