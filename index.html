<h1> Other Things You Should Know </h1>

  <p> Late in 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy
  of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter
 novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to
 a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read
 it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who
had originally disliked "the rubbish title", read the book himself. Highly
impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most
successful cinematic franchises of all time.The success of the books and films
has ensured that the Harry Potter franchise continues to expand, with numerous
derivative works,a travelling exhibitionthat premiered in Chicago in 2009, a
studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K.
Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of
spin-off films premiering in November 2016, among many other developments.Most
recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry
 Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks
 around the world.</p>
